# ep128emu-core
> Use ep128emu as a libretro core

Leverage the convenience of libretro/retroarch to emulate the Z80 based home 
computers that the original ep128emu supports - that is, Enterprise 64/128, 
Videoton TVC, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. Focus is on Enterprise and TVC.

Note: The actual documentation is best viewed in [Retroarch docs](https://docs.libretro.com/library/ep128emu/). Source for maintenance is in [libretro docs repo](https://github.com/libretro/docs/blob/master/docs/library/ep128emu.md). Standalone version also has a few fixes, see [standalone README](https://github.com/libretro/ep128emu-core/blob/standalone/README).

## Features

For the emulation features, see the [original README](README). Since GUI is replaced by retroarch, features that would require own window (debugger, keyboard layout setting, etc) are not available. Some extra features not required for original games are also excluded (SD card, SID, MIDI, Spectrum emulation card for EP, mouse).

### Content types supported:
* Enterprise disk images: `img`, `dsk`
* Enterprise tape images: `tap` (either ep128emu, tapir, or epte format)
* Enterprise compressed files: `dtf` (via "ZozoTools" ROM)
* Enterprise direct files: `com`, `trn`, `128`, `bas` or `.` (no extension)
* TVC disk images: `img`, `dsk` (TVC type guess from disk layout)
* TVC direct files: `cas`
* TVC tape images: `tvcwav` (PCM WAV format, 1-bit versions also supported)
* CPC disk images: `img`, `dsk` (CPCEMU and extended formats)
* CPC tape images: `cdt`
* Spectrum tape images: `tzx`
* Spectrum direct files: `tap`

For most content types, there is a startup sequence that will do the program loading, except for disk images. Use fast-forward if loading is slow (such as tape input).


### Input mapping and configuration
| Emulated machine | User 1 default joypad | User 2 default joypad | User 3 default joypad |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Enterprise | Internal | External 1 | External 2 |
| TVC | Internal | External 1 |  External 2 |
| CPC | External 1 | External 2 | |
| ZX | Kempston | Sinclair 1 | Sinclair 2 |

* Fire is **X** button. CPC Fire2 is **A** button.
* Joypad setup can be changed under Port Controls / Device Type
* Keyboard input is enabled
  * Be aware that retroarch uses several hotkeys by default, use "Game focus" (Scroll Lock)
* Other buttons for User 1:
  * **L**-**R**-**L2**-**R2** buttons are 0-1-2-3 (several games use these in menu)
  * Use **L3** button to display current layout
* Configurable core options:
  * wait period (set to 0 if there are performance problems, set higher to reduce CPU load)
  * use software framebuffer (slight performance improvement, may crash)
  * use high quality sound (disable if there are performance problems)
  * enable resolution changes
  * amount of border to keep when zooming in
  * use original or enhanced ROM for Enterprise (faster memory test)
  * zoom and info keys for player 1
  * autofire button and speed for player 1

### Other features
* Save/load state, rewind
* Memory maps exposed for cheat support
* Content autostart except for disk images
* Disk change support for multi-disk (or multi-tape) games
* Customizable configuration (per-content or system-wide)
  * See [sample.ep128cfg](core/sample.ep128cfg) for details
  * User 1 button map can be finetuned
  * Joypad setup for other users can be changed
  * Emulated machine type can be changed
  * Autostart can be enabled also for disk images
  * Following files are recognized in `ep128emu/config` inside retroarch system directory: `enterprise.ep128cfg`, `tvc.ep128cfg`, `cpc.ep128cfg`, `zx.ep128cfg`
  * Most options from ep128emu configuration are also recognized in .ep128cfg files,
* Fit to content
  * Pressing **R3** will zoom in to the actual content, cropping black/single-colored borders
  * Borders can be cropped completely (default) or using a margin configurable among core options

## Using the core

### Requirements

* A system with retroarch installed. Linux 64-bit, ARM 32-bit, MacOS, and Windows 32 and 64 bit versions of the core are currently available.
* From version 1.1.0, default ROM versions are built in, no need to download separately.

### Running the core
On the supported platforms, the core appears in the online updater, can be downloaded and started as usual. Running it directly:
```shell
# Linux
retroarch -L ep128emu_core_libretro.so -v <content file>
# Windows
retroarch -L ep128emu_core_libretro.dll -v <content file>
```

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome. For updating emulation features, it may be better to push it to original ep128emu as well.
